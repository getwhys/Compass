# Compass
Compass, a new kind of AI product, is trained to give you specific answers to challenging questions about software vendors. 

Customers at companies like DocuSign, Docker, and Typeform use Compass to get critical information they can't find online—like: 
- Where customers struggle with their product (and their competitors') 
- What terms you should redline in SaaS contracts 
- How software vendors price and how to talk them down 
- and… any other question they need answers to. 

[GetWhys](https://www.getwhys.io) trained Compass on InsightDB, their repository of >20,000 firsthand experiences from people who recently purchased and implemented software. For any information not already in InsightDB, Compass Pro subscribers get the answer within a 2-week AnswerSLA. (Compass Scale subscribers get answers in just one week).
